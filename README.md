# Chromatic Polynomial Calculator

The [chromatic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_polynomial) is a polynomial associated to a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). It counts the number of [graph colorings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring) as a function of the number of colors

This application enables the user to draw a graph and obtain its chromatic polynomial.
